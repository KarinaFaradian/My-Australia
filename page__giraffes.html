              There is one species and nine subspecies of giraffe, all of which
              are found throughout 15 African countries, roaming the open,
              grassy plains. They are very social creatures and are often
              spotted in groups â€“ called towers. Known as the skyscrapers of the
              African savanna, a fully grown male could grow to be almost six
              metres tall! Strewth that`s high!

              Giraffe are herbivores and can eat up to 45 kilograms (100 pounds)
              of leaves every day! Utilising their long, blue tongue (up to 53
              centimetres/20 inches long!) and even longer neck, they are able
              to eat foliage (including twigs of acacia, mimosa and wild
              apricot) from the tallest of trees. These adaptations are perfect
              for eliminating competition for food. These gentle giants have a
              keen eye and are always on the lookout for any potential danger
              from predators, such as lions and hyenas.

              Giraffe are considered to be vulnerable and are a species truly in
              need of our support. Unfortunately, humans are one of the greatest
              threats to the survival of giraffe. Habitat destruction,
              fragmentation and poaching are to blame.
