              Arriving just before dusk by 4WD, our outback campsite at Kings Creek Station is dusty and swarming with busy Herculean ants. Unperturbed, the manager directs the group towards a fenced section in the opposition direction. With late November evening temperatures mild at 18 Â°C, we linger around the camp fire before laying our swags out to rest beneath the scattered ghost gum trees.

              Sleeping outdoors exposed to nature is a humbling and ethereal experience. The night sky opens and stars slowly begin to emerge, growing brighter until the entire expanse is filled with silvery celestial bodies dancing amongst the darkness. I pause to ponder the vastness of the galaxies high above and smallness of humanity before drifting into peaceful slumber.

              Rising early to avoid the heat, Kings Canyon awaits. Our challenge is the Canyon Rim Walk, a six kilometre hike touted for its hidden treasures in the form of a sandstone domed lost city, a contoured rock amphitheatre and a swimming hole in the mythically titled Garden of Eden.

              The initial ascent up uneven steps to the crest of the canyon ridge prompts the heart to pump quicker. Forced deep breaths fill the lungs with crisp air while a gentle easterly breeze cools the sweating brow. My recently filled water bottle is quickly drained to half.

              Following the path, I traverse along rocky terrain through corridors hedged by petrified formations. The sediment and ancient fossils have intertwined forming distinctive wavy layers. The plateau provides an opportunity for admiring the spectacular landscape far below.

              Careful not to stray too close to the edge, I eagerly look out over the valley. The views are certainly impressive and one must pause to envision the ancestors of old taking shelter in the small caves and overhangs. Tawny trees congregate along the basin floor, their roots sucking nutrients from the mineral-rich soil and shallow mountain streams.
