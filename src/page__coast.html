              Infinite coasts
            </h5>

              Most of Australia`s population lives close to the coastline and the beach has long occupied a special place in the Australian identity. The Australian coastline is where three of the world`s great ocean`s meet: the Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans. The beach is also a place where people from all over the world meet, mix and live.

              The recorded history of people in their interaction with the coastline of Australia is peppered with disaster, tragedy, discovery and delight. In the past 600 years, visitors as far away as China, Portugal, Spain and Holland visited the Australian coast. The evidence of their visits lies in the remains of ships wrecked along the coastline as well as artefacts, cave drawings and paper maps. It has always been risky sailing in Australian waters, and so many failed to reach their destinations. The Encyclopedia of Australian Shipwrecks records more than 16,000 wrecks.

              For tens of thousands of years the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have fished the coastal waters. People on the north coast, from the Arafura Sea to the Torres Strait, used to trade with those from present day Indonesia and Papua New Guinea on the beaches of Australia. Until the present day, senior Goorewal women of New South Wales use their knowledge of the natural calendar, currents, winds and biology of the sea creatures to journey to the coast to collect shells for food. The making of necklaces from shells in family patterns has been passed down through the generations.
